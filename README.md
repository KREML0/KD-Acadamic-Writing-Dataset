## 📖 Towards Knowledge-Driven Detection: A Multi-Strategy Benchmark Dataset for AI-Assisted Academic Writing in Smart Education
With the rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in academic writing , accurately distinguishing between human authorship and AI-assisted creation has emerged as a pivotal challenge in Smart Education.To address this, we present the KD-Academic Writing Dataset, a pioneering large-scale, strategy-oriented benchmark dataset specifically designed for academic writing scenarios in educational settings.

## 📊 Dataset Details

The **KD-Academic Writing Dataset** is designed to bridge the gap between idealized AI detection and the complex reality of human-AI collaborative writing in educational settings. It consists of over **190,000** samples.

### 1. Intervention Strategies
We categorize the samples into two primary modes and five specific strategies to simulate the full spectrum of AI involvement in academic writing:

| Mode | Strategy | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mode I: AI-Assisted** | **Polish** | Enhancing grammar, vocabulary, and flow while preserving original structure. |
| | **Rewrite** | Paraphrasing the entire text to alter the "machine footprint" while maintaining meaning. |
| | **Expand** | Elaborating on human-written points with additional details and supporting arguments. |
| **Mode II: AI-Ghostwriting** | **Create** | Generating complete content from scratch based on specific prompts. |
| | **Iterate** | A multi-turn process: generating an initial draft followed by AI-driven refinement. |

### 2. Model Coverage
To ensure the robustness of detection benchmarks, the dataset is generated using four heterogeneous state-of-the-art Large Language Models:
* **GPT-3.5-Turbo** (OpenAI)
* **Gemini-2.0-Flash** (Google)
* **DeepSeek-Chat** (DeepSeek)
* **Doubao-1.5-Pro** (ByteDance)

## 📑 Dataset Format Explanation

All data files in this repository are stored in **TSV (Tab-Separated Values)** format.

### 1. AI-Generated Data (`ChatGPT`, `Gemini`, `DeepSeek`, `Doubao`)

The datasets within the AI model directories (covering strategies: *Create, Polish, Rewrite, Expand, Iterate*) use `\t` as the delimiter and contain the following five fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `answer_id` | String | A unique identifier for the specific AI-generated response. |
| `essay_id` | String | Foreign key linking to the original human essay source (from `Human_texts`). |
| `essay_set` | Integer | Identifier for the specific academic task (1-8), mapping to `Question-details`. |
| `prompt_id` | Integer | Identifier for the intervention strategy used (e.g., 1: Polish, 2: Rewrite, etc.). |
| `answer` | String | The full text of the AI-generated or AI-modified academic content. |

### 2. Human Data (`Human_texts`)

The original human-authored essays serve as the ground truth (Mode: Human) and contain three core fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `essay_id` | String | Unique identifier for the human essay. |
| `essay_set` | Integer | Identifier for the specific academic task (1-8). |
| `essay` | String | The original text written by the student. |
